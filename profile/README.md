# Women In GovTech

The Women in GovTech Community aims to create a supportive community for young professional women who are working in government technology roles. Our goal is to provide a platform for these professionals to connect, learn, and grow together in their careers in the GovTech industry. Through networking and educational opportunities, we hope to inspire and empower women to advance in their roles and break through the barriers that often exist in male-dominated industries. Our club welcomes women from all backgrounds and experiences who share a passion for technology and a commitment to promoting diversity and inclusivity in the workplace.
